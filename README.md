🌊 Underwater Image Enhancement using OpenCV 🚀 Project Overview This project applies computer vision techniques to enhance underwater images, improving visibility, color correction, and noise reduction. The enhanced images provide better clarity for marine research, underwater photography, and conservation efforts.

📌 Features

  ✅ Color Correction – Adjusts underwater color balance using LAB color space & CLAHE

  ✅ White Balancing – Removes blue-green tint for more natural colors

  ✅ Noise Reduction – Applies Non-Local Means Denoising for a smoother image

  ✅ User-Friendly Web App – Allows users to upload, enhance, and download underwater images

📌 Technologies Used

🔹 Python – Core language for image processing

🔹 OpenCV – Image enhancement & filtering

🔹 Streamlit – Web app deployment

🔹 NumPy – Image manipulation

🔹 GitHub & Streamlit Cloud – Deployment

📌 How It Works?

1️⃣ User uploads an underwater image (JPG/PNG)

2️⃣ The AI enhances clarity by applying:

   Contrast Adjustment (CLAHE)

   White Balancing

   Noise Reduction (Denoising Algorithm)
   
3️⃣ The user downloads the enhanced image

📌 Installation & Running Locally

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/underwaterenhancement.git
  
  cd underwater-enhancement
  
2️⃣ Install Dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
3️⃣ Run the Web App

  streamlit run app.py
  
The app will open in your browser. 🎯

📌 Deployment (Host on Streamlit Cloud)

1️⃣ Push your project to GitHub

2️⃣ Go to Streamlit Cloud

3️⃣ Deploy your repo & select app.py as the main file

📌 Sample Results
